# JsDevEnvironment
Building up an automated js dev environment

This project is to be used as a boilerplate / template for a 
javascript development environment. It is based on developer Cory House's
Pluralsight course 'Building a Javascript Development Environment' 
(a very recommended course) and will first look very similar and have 
same preferences to mr House. It will evolve from there as my knowledge 
of tools available will grow.

# Personal Considerations

-- Mocking Libraries --
Whether to use Json Server and for what purposes:
Being described as strongly opinionated about what "a fake rest api 
should look like". House also says "If your a fan of hypermedia this won't do it."
and it raises a question:
    - Will this choice affect the Restful constraint: 
      "Hypermedia as the engine of application state"?
