# IMPORTANT
THIS IS BOILERPLATE CODE FOR DEVELOPMENT, NOT FOR PRODUCTION!!!
You should NOT use this boilerplate code as is when building for production!
Always configure and adjust to your production environment with SECURITY FIRST in mind!
- Read the documentation and/or guides for your specific production environment.

# JsDevEnvironment 
This project is to be used as a boilerplate / template for a 
javascript development environment. It was based on developer Cory House's
Pluralsight course 'Building a Javascript Development Environment' 
(a very recommended course). It has evolved from there but has stuck to most of those tools.
