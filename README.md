# JsDevEnvironment
Building up an automated js dev environment

This project is to be used as a boilerplate / template for a 
javascript development environment. It is based on developer Cory House's
Pluralsight course 'Building a Javascript Development Environment' 
(a very recommended course). It has evolved from there but has stuck to most of those tools.
